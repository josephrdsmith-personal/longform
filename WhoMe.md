# Who I Am

*A rough concatenation that attempts to convey meaning &*  
*A simplified list that reflects what I believe is most important.*

**Wickedly neurodivergent, deeply compassionate, intensely engaged.**

*(If you're not into this already, you could bail out now.)*

Below are the words I use to define myself, showing you what's important to me. Following that, I'll share my history - both personal and professional. Finally, I'll address some of the overloaded signifiers that typically arise (or should arise) in early-stage conversations - diversity, performance management (for all roles with people management responsibilities), and my own technical capabilities.

I realize that this isn't the traditional format.  I'm not traditional.  My work history is neat, but it's not me.  

The way that I work is the way that I am.  If I'm going to commit myself to working closely with you, I want to know you and be known by you.  I absolutely don't want to feel like I have to hide parts of myself from you because your knowing them is grounds for my exclusion.  I've found that lots of people feel the same way I do; so here's me, up front.  Maybe if we shifted to being more human in these processes, they wouldn't be as hard.

## Core Values

### Artist  

I express myself through everything I do, with thought and feeling. Code, software, systems, painting, writing, theater - these are all forms of expression. While technique can be learned and practiced (and is crucial for what matters to you), it's the caring that makes it real. It's about becoming so invested that you stay up late, wake up early, and even dream about it. These are the things worth dedicating our lives to.  I do my best to live the questions.

I constantly ask:
- What can I do to make this more beautiful, meaningful, and impactful?  
- What could I do better next time?
- What techniques am I missing?
- What tools could I use?
- Who can I learn from to improve?

### Student

Socrates essentially said "all I know is that I know nothing," and that resonates deeply with me. My curiosity drives my passion as much as anything else  - everything fascinates me, and everyone has something to teach.

### Human in Community

Everyone deserves unconditional positive regard. While their behavior may be inappropriate and require boundaries or exclusion, they still deserve respect and kindness.  My favorite question to ask: "What's it like to be you?"

## Personal History

I emerged from challenging beginnings as the oldest of nine in a violent, ultra-conservative household. By 15, I was a high school dropout, homeless, and struggling with hard drug addiction. After turning 18 in juvenile detention, I briefly escaped to Hawaii before returning to face my responsibilities. Upon release, I tested into Robert Clark Honors College at the University of Oregon, pursuing a dual major in MACS (Mathematics and Computer Science) and Philosophy.

During my junior year, I built a Beowulf cluster that caught Microsoft's attention, leading to an offer from Microsoft Games Studio. I was working two jobs and had my second child on the way, and they offered me more money than anyone in my extended family had ever seen in their life.  Goodbye college, hello Redmond.

## Professional Journey

**Given the diversity of my experiences over time, I've kept it high level for this abstract.   There's a lot left out, if you have questions, please ask.**

While at Microsoft, I ran a foster care group home for at-risk youth facing institutionalization. When two indigenous children lost their mother, I became their guardian - notably becoming the first white person granted guardianship from that tribal community since the Indian Child Welfare Act's passage. Adapting to teenage parenthood before 30 was challenging - but worth it.

I also built out the first Xbox multiplayer automation farm, contributed to a significant number of networking patents,  taught classes on pairwise combinatorics, and led a large distributed team of 70 people - engineers, project managers, testers, and support staff - for the Asheron's Call massively multiplayer game franchise.  If you read this, and you played, let me know.  It's (almost) always fun to hear from those folks.

### Career Evolution
- Post-Microsoft: Took well-paying but less engaging roles, prioritizing family
- Worked on some super secret squirrel projects that were really cool at the time but not really interesting anymore - I can talk about them in 22 more years
- Then joined a startup that was acquired by Yahoo!, where I optimized ad-server networks and operational infrastructure
- Worked at Opscode (later Chef Software) while raising seven children
	- worked with the majority of the Fortune50
	- key thought leadership of Infrastructure as Code - design, philosophy, and infrastructure as code
	- worked directly with the team that became DORA (Nathen, Nichole, Jez)
	- managed all software projects, including OSS
	- managed SaaS - millions of daily transactions, business critical for our customers
	- led the transition to Chef-on-Chef
- Post-Chef acquisition: Spent a year at CircleCI restructuring their security strategy
	- worked through extremely complex compliance hurdles: deep cross collaboration
	- created cryptomining abuse team: hiring, roadmap, system design
- Recent years: Outer Labs, collaborating with Google on complex data visualization and workflow projects in the ML/AI space (mostly heterogenous data aggregation, transformation, parsing across diverse ontologies)
	- Direct contributor to Google corp codebase
	- Hired ~25 engineers
	- Hired 3 engineering managers
	- multiple patent submissions
	- SBIR submissions

## What I'm Looking For

I'm looking for a place to work.  Not a job.  I want to be engaged in a way that lights up my curiosity, gives me room to think and create, and allows me work with smart and kind people.  I'm driven to create value through interaction - the context isn't as important as the possibility.

### Essential Requirements:
1. Psychologically mature, diverse, and positive organization
2. Smaller team of intelligent people emphasizing collaboration and maker time
3. Complex, meaningful problems in an interesting space
4. Stable benefits and compensation package
5. Equity participation

## Core Principles

### On Diversity
I believe in embracing our differences while acknowledging the inherent challenges they present. We can never fully understand others' experiences, but by creating communities where authentic self-expression thrives alongside kindness and acceptance, we all improve together. I have zero tolerance for anti-human behavior patterns.  I've done post-graduate research work on the gender pay gap in tech and how women are socially incentivized to do "soft work" and then penalized for it in performance and compensation reviews.  I've also written on how diversity, as an emergent property of a system which prioritizes inclusion, leads to significantly higher factors of innovation.

### On Performance Management
Growth and learning are fundamental, but approaches must be tailored. While growth targets and stretch goals matter, some excel through self-motivation. I oppose arbitrary metrics that can be gamed or fall outside team control. I have extensive experience in both developing talent and managing necessary transitions.

### On Technical Capacity
I'm a generalist with deep technical experience across multiple domains. My strengths lie in:
- Technical design : decomposition, elaboration, estimation
- Synthesis : how do things fit together, and do they do that well?
- Infrastructure : where does this get built and how?
- Security : are we safe and are we breaking the law?
- Process development : how do we work together effectively?
- Systems design and architecture : how can we build everything we need to effectively?
- OSS : who has already done this, and can we learn from them through engaging?

While I can adapt to most technical requirements, I'm most effective when given appropriate ramp-up time for specialized implementations (the importance of maker-time.)  I've worked in so many stacks, languages, and frameworks that it would be a big list.  

I'm probably not going to do a coding interview.  I can talk about past projects, and I can spin things up quickly if you need them.  The part of my brain that talks isn't the part of my brain that knows python.  I'll just get more and more nervous trying to prove it to you, and it will stink for both of us.  

### What I Avoid (and you can too)
- Low-trust environments
- Overly bureaucratic or top-heavy organizations
- Homogeneous cultures
- Toxic personalities (while welcoming directness and honesty)
