Who I Am

a rough concatenation that attempts to convey meaning &

a simplified list that reflects what i believe is most important.

Wickedly neurodivergent, deeply compassionate, intensely engaged.

(If you’re not into it already, you could bail out now.)

I’ve got a few more words below that I use to define myself, and hopefully show you what’s important to me.  After that, I’ll talk about my history - personal and professional.  Finally, I’ll speak to  some of the over-loaded signifiers that get discussed (or at least should be discussed) in early-stage conversations - diversity, performance, and technical capacity.  These sometimes feel just a little tense when I’m being asked.  This is my attempt to make that easier on folks - asking “hey how do you feel about people who don’t look/act/talk like you, have you fired anyone, do you actually know how to do the job” are hard questions, and it’s a world full of people, so you have to ask them.  At the same time, this makes it quicker, yeah?

Expressing myself through everything I do, with thought and feeling.  Code, software, systems, painting, writing, theater - these are all ways for us to express ourselves.  Technique can be learned and practiced, and is important for the things you care about.  Caring is the thing that makes it real, though.  Letting something become important enough that you stay up late and wake up early and even dream about it.  Those are the things worth spending our lives doing.  Always asking: what can I do to make this more beautiful, more meaningful, more impactful?  What could I do better next time?  What techniques am I missing?  What tools could I use?  Who can I ask to help me learn to do this better?

Student.

Socrates said “all i know is I don’t know sh** about f***-all” and that like, really spoke to me.  I’m passionate about learning, and my curiosity is like a rushing river - everything is so interesting, and everyone has something to teach you.  

Friend.

Everyone deserves unconditional positive regard.  Their behavior may be inappropriate and unwelcome, and that behavior may require boundaries of exclusion.  Even so, they deserve respect and kindness.

History:

I’m the oldest of nine; I grew up in a violent, ultra-conservative household.  High school dropout, homeless, and addicted to hard drugs by 15, I turned 18 in juvenile detention.  I escaped, went to Hawaii for awhile, and then came back and turned myself in so I wouldn’t have to hide anymore.  When released, I tested into Robert Clark Honors College at the University of Oregon - where I was dual major MACS (math and computer science) and Philosophy.  My junior year, I built a beowulf cluster that caught the attention of some folks at Microsoft, who offered me more money than I’d ever heard of to come work in Microsoft Games Studio.   I had just found out I was going to have my second child - so accepted the job.

While at Microsoft, I ran a foster care group home for kids who were on their last chance before being institutionalized.  There were two kids whose mom passed away while there, so I closed down the house and worked to get guardianship of them.  I didn’t know it at the time, but I was the first white person to get guardianship of indigenous children from that tribal community since the Indian Child Welfare Act was passed.  It was interesting to become a dad for teenage kids before I was 30, but we figured it out.

After Microsoft, I took a few jobs that were interesting but weren’t really work.  They paid well and I did a good job, but I was more focused on family.  After a few years of that, I joined a startup which eventually sold to Yahoo!, with a two year agreement that I would stay on and help optimize their ad-server networks.

Post-Yahoo!, I joined some of my friends at their startup, Opscode, which became Chef Software.  By this time I had six kids altogether - and then there were seven.  Chef was an amazing experience, and I am incredibly grateful for everything I was able to learn and do - and all the wonderful people I met along the way.  I worked with people from more than half of the Fortune50 - and was solving real problems for them on a regular basis.  There’s lots more about my time at Chef that I could share, depending on the relevance - both bullet lists and longform. 

After Chef was acquired, I worked for CircleCI for a year, creating the strategy for deconstructing their security team and rebuilding it appropriately for the work in front of them.  It was interesting, and I was able to do neat things and work with great people, but it wasn’t the right environment for me.

For the past few years, I’ve been at Outer Labs, working with Google to translate some of their more complicated multi-dimensional business logic into concretized visualizations wrapped around user-centric workflows.  Basically, they had tons of heterogenous data from lots of different ontologies and formats, and they needed a way to make decisions more accurately.  They also needed this written and delivered within their corporate infrastructure.  Super neat problem set, working with brilliant people on an incredibly diverse, incredibly brilliant team.  

So What Now?

I’m open to a range of possibilities.  Here’s what I need:

1: Psychologically mature, diverse, and positive organization. 

2: Smaller team, smart people, emphasis on collaboration and maker time.

3: Complex problems in an interesting space.  I need to be convinced that this is a worthwhile use of my time, energy, and attention. 

4: Baseline stability, including benefits and salary.  (This doesn’t have to mean extended runway - that’s not a way I’m quantifying risk.)

5: Equity.  This is part of the conversation that includes part 4; I can’t answer any questions about 4 without understanding this. 

Important Notes:

Diversity:

We are all different, and embracing that difference while acknowledging the inherent challenge is good for us.  We never know how different we are, because we don’t have access to anyone else’s experience.  I believe that by leaning into that difference and building communities where we are able to authentically express ourselves in kind and tolerant ways, we all get better together.  We can smooth away the rough edges that make it hard for us, and enable the type of engagement and collaboration that lead to amazing and beautiful results.  Anti-human behavior patterns are disgusting and I have very low tolerance for them.

Performance Management:

Growth and Learning are fundamental to the engaged experience.  Creating growth targets and stretch goals is really important; and at the same time, some people are super happy and self-motivated without them.  Measuring targets by arbitrary measures which are easily gamed, incentivize anti-pattern behavior, or are outside of the scope of the person or teams control - all anti-patterns which won’t help the team doing the work.  I’ve managed lots of people up, and I’ve managed lots of people out.  I’ve also trained other folks on how to do this effectively and humanely.

Technical Capacity:

At this point, I’m a generalist with deep technical experience in most of the broader categories.  I’ve been lucky enough to work with people who were passionate about one language or one domain, and stayed there for decades  - so I know what great looks and feels like.  What I’m great at is alignment building, synthesis, infrastructure, security, process, systems design, systems architecture, collaboration, and management.  I can do most other things, and am absolutely happy to try - but if you’re looking for an engineer to do X in a specific system or language, I’m not the best fit for that thing specifically, unless there’s time in the system for me to ramp up effectively and/or it’s a key responsibility that allows me to dedicate the time needed to get good.

What I don’t want:

Low trust environments.

Very large, overly bureaucratic, or top heavy environments.

Homogenous culture.

I mean, jerks and bullies.  That’s what I’m saying here.  Directness, straightforwardness, honesty - that’s all great.  I don’t want to work with people that make me feel bad, about myself or anything else.
